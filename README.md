**For detailed technical documentation, see [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md)**

- Encrypt sensitive data **in transit and at rest**.
- Apply **secure data storage and transmission practices** throughout both backend and frontend.
- Use **tamper-resistant payloads** and enforce secure authentication and authorization consistently.

**Architecture and Design Principles:**

- Follow **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, **DRY**, and **KISS** practices.
- Maintain **clear separation of concerns** across domain logic, application services, infrastructure, state management, UI components, and event orchestration.
- Minimize external dependencies, favoring **native platform capabilities** and relying only on essential, open-source, free, and LTS-supported libraries.
- Ensure **long-term maintainability, scalability, high performance, deterministic behavior, and minimal technical debt**.

**Key Features:**

- Centralized management of **suppliers, products, collections, and payments**.
- **Historical and dynamic rate management**, preserving applied rates for historical entries and automatically using the latest rates for new data.
- Automated, auditable calculations for **advance and partial payments**, ensuring accuracy in total amounts owed.
- **Multi-device and multi-user support** for real-time collaboration and concurrent data entry.
- **Robust financial tracking** suitable for complex workflows, including agricultural collection scenarios (e.g., tea leaves, produce collection).

**Example Use Case – Tea Leaves Collection:**

- Users visit multiple suppliers daily and record quantities collected in **multiple units** (kg, g, etc.).
- Payments may be made intermittently (advance or partial payments).
- At the end of the month, rates per unit are finalized, and total payments are automatically calculated.
- The system ensures **accurate tracking, no duplication or corruption**, and provides **transparent and auditable financial oversight**.

**Technical and Operational Goals:**

- Enable reliable **multi-user collaboration** across multiple devices.
- Guarantee **data integrity** under all operational conditions.
- Support **precise tracking, reporting, and reconciliation** for multi-unit and multi-rate collections.
- Ensure **secure, scalable, and maintainable architecture**, optimized for real-world business workflows.

**Deliverables:**

- Production-ready React Native (Expo) frontend with intuitive UI and UX.
- Laravel backend with robust data management, security, and conflict resolution mechanisms.
- Fully documented architecture, including **domain models, database schema, business logic, and security protocols**.
- End-to-end test coverage for CRUD operations, concurrency handling, and financial calculations.
