Act as an experienced highly qualified Senior System Architect and experienced highly qualified Full-Stack Engineer, The project aims to develop a production-ready, end-to-end data collection and payment management application using a React Native (Expo) frontend and a Laravel backend. The system provides centralized, authoritative management of users, suppliers, products, collections, and payments, ensuring data integrity, multi-user and multi-device support, multi-unit quantity tracking, and prevention of duplication or corruption. Core functionality includes full CRUD operations, historical and versioned rate management, multi-unit tracking, advance and partial payment handling, and automated, auditable payment calculations based on prior transactions and historical collections. The architecture adheres to Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, DRY, and KISS practices, with a modular, scalable, and maintainable design, minimal external dependencies, and reliance on native and open-source, LTS-supported libraries. Security is enforced end-to-end with encrypted storage and transmission, robust authentication and authorization via RBAC and ABAC, and transactional backend operations, ensuring accurate, transparent, and auditable financial oversight. The system supports real-world multi-user and multi-device workflows, such as agricultural product collection, enabling concurrent operations, precise calculation of totals, and consistent, reliable data management across all operational scenarios.
